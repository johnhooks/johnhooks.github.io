Git is a unique beast of a program. For years I had been using it at the most bare minimum of it's capacity . It took was getting involved with an open source project that opened my eyes to the power of source control.

I had a task. I was using a library, found an issue in the documentation and figured out how to fix it. So I created an issue on GitHub and the maintainer asked if I could do a _PR_... I had to look that up ðŸ˜‚. Though, through the graceful help of the maintainer and a lot of googling, I finally cobbled together an acceptable pull request, and it was merged. I was hooked.

This article is space for me to document some of the simple workflows I learned.

  I've only used GitHub for collaboration, so this article will be skewed toward it's workflow.

## Forking

A fork is an copy of a repository that can submit pull request to the [upstream repository](#upstream-repo).

I made a few mistakes after my first attempts at forking a repo. The first was to commit changes directly into the `main` branch. It wasn't apparent it was an issue until I want to sync my fork back to the [upstream repo](#upstream-repo) so I could make another PR.

## Upstream Repo

The repository from which a forked was made.
