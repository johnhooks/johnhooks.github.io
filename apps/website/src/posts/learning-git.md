Git is a unique beast of a program. For years I had been using it at the most bare minimum of it's capacity . It took was getting involved with an open source project that opened my eyes to the power of source control.

I had a task. I was using a library, found an issue in the documentation and figured out how to fix it. So I created an issue on GitHub and the maintainer asked if I could do a _PR_... I had to look that up ðŸ˜‚. Though, through the graceful help of the maintainer and a lot of googling, I finally cobbled together an acceptable pull request, and it was merged. I was hooked.

This article is space for me to document some of the simple workflows I learned.

<DocInfo>
  I've only used GitHub for collaboration, so this article will be skewed toward it's workflow.
