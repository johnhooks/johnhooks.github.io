My nine year old daughter asked me if I could help her build a website. The request brought up more emotion than I expected.

First of all, I am very excited that she is interested in coding. I can't wait to share something I love and hope its something we can do together for a long time. I am not a professional developer, though I have dabbled in web since my freshmen year of high school. I've continued to learn to program because I find it so powerfully rewarding to make the computer do what I intended. It's a fun challenge to model a problem in a way the computer can solve.

Though I am also nervous that I could mess this up. I know a child's interest can be fleeting and I may not have many opportunities to excite her interest.
