# My Website

[johnhooks.io](https://johnhooks.io)

This is the repo for my personal website. Using [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev), it is
statically built though a GitHub Action and deployed to GitHub Pages.

I use this site as a place to learn new things and also make notes that as much for my own retention
of information as for sharing with others.

## Developing

Once you've downloaded the project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of the app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.
